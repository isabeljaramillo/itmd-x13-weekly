my_string = '...You can say that again...'
puts my_string
puts my_string

name = 'Anya Christina Emmanuella Jenkins Harris'
puts 'My name is ' + name + '.'
puts 'Wow! ' + name
puts 'is a really long name!'

# Also, just as we can assign an object to a variable, we can reassign a
# different object to that variable. (This is why we call them variablesâ€”
# what they point to can vary.)

# Example of reassining objects to that variable,..
composer = 'Mozart'
puts composer + ' was "da bomb" in his day.'

composer = 'Beethoven'
puts 'But I prefer ' + composer + ', personally.'

# Variables can point to any kind of object, not just strings:
my_own_var = 'just another ' + 'string'
puts my_own_var

my_own_var = 5 * (1+2)
puts my_own_var

#In fact, variables can point to just about anything...except other vari- ables.
var1 = 8
var2 = var1
puts var1
#8

puts var2
#8

puts ' '
var1 = 'eight'
puts var1
puts var2
